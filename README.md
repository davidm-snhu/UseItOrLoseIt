# UseItOrLoseIt
This repository stores a document for a hypothetical client called The Gaming Room, desribing how they could start porting an existing Android game to other platforms via a web interface. The client had already been working on the game, and was willing to pick up development after the initial steps, so the focus was on minimzing change and making recommendations on how they could begin developing for other platforms.

The best thing I did while developing this documentation was integrating pre-existing understanding of hardware constraints and hardware platforms. This let me fill out a lot of the document very early, and then refine it over time while doing reading for the class.

The most helpful thing about coding from a design document, for me, is to constrain what problems really need to be solved. While implementing new features, many considerations and possibilities for other features naturally come to mind. I find it easy to get distracted and fall down "rabbit-holes" when writing code without clear goals in mind. With a design document, it's clear what still needs to be done, and what could be done, at another time.

The main thing I would revise in these documents is adding citations or further reading for the client's benefit. Although opaque recommendations from some trusted person can still be beneficial, giving the other party access to learning the reasons behind the recommendations improves the overall value of the exchange.

I interpreted the user's needs by taking a minimalist approach, trying to avoid guessing what they "really want" ahead of what they've actually asked for. Considering the user's needs gets them met sooner by focusing the work on exactly what needs to be done.

I approached designing this software by considering what the smallest piece of the requirements would be, implementing that, and checking that it worked one piece at a time before moving on. In the future for a similar application, I would spend some time upfront learning the build system to minimize how often I need to context switch between implementing small features.
